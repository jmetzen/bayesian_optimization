class BayesianOptimizer(object):
    """Bayesian optimization for global black-box optimization

    Bayesian optimization models the landscape of the function to be optimized
    internally by a surrogate model (typically a Gaussian process) and
    evaluates always those parameters which are considered as global optimum
    of an acquisition function defined over this surrogate model. Different
    acquisition functions and optimizers can be used internally.

    Bayesian optimization aims at reducing the number of evaluations of the
    actual function, which is assumed to be costly. To achieve this, a large
    computational budget is allocated at modelling the true function and finding
    potentially optimal positions based on this model.

                 "A tutorial on Bayesian optimization of expensive cost
                  functions, with application to active user modelling and
                  hierarchical reinforcement learning"

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : surrogate model object
        The surrogate model which is used to model the objective function. It
        needs to provide a methods fit(X, y) for training the model and
        predictive_distribution(X) for determining the predictive distribution
        (mean, std-dev) at query point X.

    acquisition_function : acquisition function object
        When called, this function returns the acquisitability of a query point
        i.e., how favourable it is to perform an evaluation at the query point.
        For this, internally the trade-off between exploration and exploitation
        is handled.

    optimizer: string, default: "direct"
        The optimizer used to identify the maximum of the acquisition function.
        The optimizer is specified by a string which may be any of "direct",
        "direct+lbfgs", "random", "random+lbfgs", "cmaes", or "cmaes+lbfgs".

    maxf: int, default: 1000
        The maximum number of evaluations of the acquisition function by the
        optimizer.

    initial_random_samples: int, default: 5
        The number of initial sample, in which random query points are selected
        without using the acquisition function. Setting this to values larger
        than 0 might be required if the surrogate model needs to be trained
        on datapoints before evaluating it.

    random_state : RandomState or int (default: None)
        Seed for the random number generator.

class REMBOOptimizer(BayesianOptimizer):
    """ Random EMbedding Bayesian Optimization (REMBO).

    This extension of Bayesian Optimizer (BO) is better suited for
    high-dimensional problems with a low effective dimensionality than BO.
    This is achieved by restricting the optimization to a low-dimensional
    linear manifold embedded in the higher dimensional space. Theoretical
    results suggest that even if the manifold is chosen randomly, the
    optimum on this manifold equals the global optimum if the function is
    indeed of the same intrinsic dimensionality as the manifold.

                 Embeddings", International Joint Conferences on Artificial
                 Intelligence (IJCAI), 2013

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_dims : int
        The dimensionality of the actual search space

    n_embedding_dims : int, default: 2
        The dimensionality of the randomly chosen linear manifold on which the
        optimization is performed

    data_space: array-like, shape=[n_dims, 2], default: None
        The boundaries of the data-space. This is used for scaling the mapping
        from embedded space to data space, which is useful if dimensions of the
        data space have different ranges or are not centred around 0.

    n_keep_dims : int, default: 0
        The number of dimensions which are not embedded in the manifold but are
        kept 1-to-1 in the representation. This can be useful if some
        dimensions are known to be relevant. Note that it is expected that
        those dimensions come first in the data representation, i.e., the first
        n_keep_dims dimensions are maintained.
